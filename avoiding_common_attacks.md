# Avoiding Common Attacks
## Function / data structure exposure
It is best practice to explicitly state the permission level of each of your functions and data structures so that you are completely aware of what functions and data are visible to or callable by wallet addresses or other contract addresses.
Described permission level for each function i.e. external, internal, public, and private

## Contract ownership
Issued the ownership and administrative privileges to the owner-specific function.

## Optimizing Usage of Loops
Avoided loops as this dapp currently at this stage doesn't require it and there is no point in forcibly adding it as they make contract more vulnerable to attacks
